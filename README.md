# Flixter

Flixter is a web application designed for teachers and students via video platform lessons. A user can either sign up as a teacher and create video course materials for students, or a user could be the student and sign up for a wide variety of different video courses.  

# Getting Started

To get started, first visit https://flixter-nacoda.herokuapp.com/ and click the "Explore Courses" button on the home page to explore different course material Flixter has to offer. 

If you would like to take a course you will have to create a profile. To do that, simply navigate to the drop down menu at the top right of the page and click on "Sign Up". Once you are registered you will then be able to enroll in any video courses you may choose.

Wanting to teach? Navigate to the bottom of the home page to "Teach a Course" to create a new video course. You will be asked to create a "Title", "Description", "Cost" and upload an image. Then, you will be directed to your very own course where you can "Add a new section" along with as many lessons as you'd like.
